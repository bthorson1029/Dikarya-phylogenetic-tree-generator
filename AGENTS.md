# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents, including Claude Code (claude.ai/code),
when working with code in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a local symlink to this file.

## What This Is

Dikarya is a Flask web application for fungal phylogenetic analysis. Users submit DNA sequences (FASTA or GenBank accessions), which are run through a configurable bioinformatics pipeline (alignment → trimming → tree building) via background workers, with real-time status updates via Server-Sent Events. Results are displayed in an interactive tree viewer.

## Commands

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Database migrations
flask db migrate -m "description"
flask db upgrade

# Run web app (dev)
export FLASK_APP=wsgi.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run --port=5000

# Start background worker (required for job processing)
flask run-worker

# Start metrics collector
flask run-metrics

# Check whether any job is running BEFORE restarting the worker (which kills them).
# Exits 1 and lists the jobs if any are in flight.
flask jobs-in-flight

# Reconcile Postgres against RQ, then mark long-abandoned jobs as failed. Each
# stuck job keeps an SSE stream alive, and every open stream holds one of the
# (workers x threads) request slots, so leaving them can make the site stop
# responding. Always dry-run first. Connects to production PostgreSQL
# (escalated/outside-sandbox).
flask reap-stuck-jobs --older-than-days 1 --dry-run
flask reap-stuck-jobs --older-than-days 1

# After explicit user approval only: add a What's New changelog entry.
# This connects to production PostgreSQL, so run it with escalated/outside-sandbox
# permissions on the first attempt rather than trying it in the sandbox first.
source .venv/bin/activate && scripts/dikarya_whats_new.py add --title "Title here" --body "Description of what changed." --category feature
# Categories: feature, fix, improvement, update

# List existing What's New entries (also requires production PostgreSQL access,
# so use escalated/outside-sandbox permissions on the first attempt)
source .venv/bin/activate && scripts/dikarya_whats_new.py list
```

Production runs under systemd as `dikarya-web.service` (Gunicorn) and `dikarya-worker.service` (RQ worker). Agents can restart these services via the sudo wrappers documented in the "Restarting Dikarya services" section below — do not ask for permission, just run the appropriate wrapper after changes that require it. **Restarting the web service is safe; restarting the worker kills any job that is currently running — check first (see "Restarting Dikarya services").**

## Architecture

### Pipeline Steps (in order)

`INPUT → ORIENT → BLAST → ALIGN → TRIM → TREE → POST`

ORIENT (sequence orientation), BLAST (homolog search), and TRIM are optional. The tree viewer at `/job/<id>/view` allows post-hoc pruning, rerooting, and renaming.

### Services (`app/services/`)

Each bioinformatics step has its own service module. All external tool invocations go through `subprocess_utils.py`. Input validation and path safety live in `security_utils.py`. The `access_control.py` module enforces job ownership.

### Job Parameters

`app/models.py` defines the dataclasses: `JobParams`, `AlignmentParams`, `TreeBuilderParams`, `TrimmingParams`. These are serialized to `var/jobs/{job_id}/input_info.json`.

### File Layout on Disk

Verified against all ~10,900 job directories. The previous version of this block
listed `aligned.fasta`, `trimmed.fasta`, `tree/tree.nexus` and a root-level
`blast_results.json`, none of which the pipeline has ever written — the v1 API's
artifact map had copied the same wrong paths and those downloads always 404'd.

```
var/jobs/{job_id}/
  input_info.json          submitted params + the ORIGINAL submitted FASTA
  tree_state.json          viewer state: pruning, renames, rooting
  input/input_raw.fasta    the PROCESSED input (deduped/oriented/BLAST-augmented)
  blast/blast_results.json
  alignment/alignment_raw.fasta          aligned, untrimmed
            alignment_trimmed.fasta      what the tree builder consumed
            alignment_trimmed_report.html   trimAl -htmlout (gzipped at rest)
            alignment_pruned*.fasta      recompute's derived set
  tree/tree_original.{newick,nexus}
       tree_pruned.{newick,nexus}
       tree_metadata.json
  logs/{pipeline,alignment,tree_builder}.log
```

**`input_info.json["sequence"]` is not a duplicate of `input/input_raw.fasta`.**
The first is exactly what the user submitted; the second is what the pipeline
derived from it after dedup, orientation and BLAST augmentation. They differ in
43% of jobs (records both added and removed). Recompute and the
restore-removed-duplicates endpoint both need the original, so do not "dedupe"
these against each other.

### Compressed artifacts

Large cold artifacts are stored gzipped. **Never `open()` a job artifact
directly** — go through `app/services/artifact_storage.py`, which resolves
`foo.fasta` to `foo.fasta.gz` transparently:

| Instead of | Use |
|---|---|
| `open(p)` | `open_artifact(p, "rt")` |
| `p.is_file()` | `artifact_exists(p)` |
| `p.stat().st_size` | `artifact_size(p)` (uncompressed size) |
| `p.read_bytes()` | `read_artifact_bytes(p)` |
| `send_file(p)` | resolve first; send decompressed bytes for a `.gz` |

The plain file always wins when both forms exist, so a step that rewrites an
artifact just writes plain as before — call `discard_gzipped_form(p)` first so
the stale archive does not linger. Currently gzipped: the trimAl HTML reports
and the aligned/trimmed FASTAs. Deliberately left plain: `input_raw.fasta`,
`tree_state.json` and `input_info.json`, because each is rewritten in place by a
normal user action (add sequences, every viewer edit, recompute).

`scripts/dikarya_reclaim_job_space.py` applies all of this retroactively and
runs weekly from `ops/cron/dikarya-reclaim-job-space`. It **must run as the
`dikarya` user** — `var/jobs` is dikarya-owned and the `tree` user cannot write
there, so agents cannot run it and must ask the human:

```bash
sudo -u dikarya /var/www/dikarya/.venv/bin/python \
  scripts/dikarya_reclaim_job_space.py --dry-run     # always dry-run first
sudo -u dikarya /var/www/dikarya/.venv/bin/python \
  scripts/dikarya_reclaim_job_space.py --apply
```

Jobs touched within `--min-age-hours` (default 24) are skipped, so a live run is
never disturbed. The passes (`scratch`, `logs`, `json`, `reports`, `alignments`)
are independent and individually selectable with `--passes`.

## Restarting Dikarya services

Agents may restart the Dikarya systemd services when needed after making changes. The `tree` user has limited passwordless sudo access to three root-owned wrapper scripts only:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/sbin/restart-dikarya-web
sudo /usr/local/sbin/restart-dikarya-worker
sudo /usr/local/sbin/restart-dikarya-metrics
```

Use these wrappers instead of running sudo systemctl restart ... directly.

The most commonly needed restart is:

sudo /usr/local/sbin/restart-dikarya-web

Run this after changes that affect the web application runtime, routes, views/templates, Python application code, configuration read by the web process, dependencies, or other behavior served by the Dikarya web app.

Use the worker or metrics restart wrappers only when the change affects those specific background services.

### Run the preflight import check before any restart

```bash
scripts/dikarya-preflight && sudo /usr/local/sbin/restart-dikarya-web
```

It imports the modules the web and worker processes need and exits 1 with the
traceback if any of them fails. Gunicorn does not import worker code until a
request arrives, so an import error survives a "successful" restart and only
appears when a user hits it.

This is not hypothetical: on 2026-08-14 `app/workers/tasks.py` was deployed
importing a name `app/services/log_context.py` did not define yet. Because
`enqueue_job()` imports the task module inside the request handler, `POST
/api/job` returned 500 for 3.5 hours and seven queued jobs died in the worker
with RQ's misleading `ValueError: Invalid attribute name: run_phylo_job` — which
is what `import_attribute()` reports when the module behind the name will not
import. The preflight catches exactly this, and costs about a second.

Add new must-import modules to the list inside the script rather than replacing
it. The script deliberately does not call `create_app()`, which needs the
root-only `SECRET_KEY`, so it runs fine as `tree`.

### Restarting the worker kills running jobs

`restart-dikarya-worker` SIGKILLs the RQ work horse. Any job mid-run loses its work
— a user's alignment or tree simply dies partway through, and the killed process
never reaches the `except` block that would mark it failed, so its database row is
left stranded. This has really happened: on 2026-07-28 two agent-initiated worker
restarts killed two jobs mid-MAFFT (0-byte `alignment_raw.fasta`), and they sat at
`running` for nine days.

**Always check before restarting the worker:**

```bash
flask jobs-in-flight    # exits 1 and lists them if any job is live
```

**Agents usually cannot run that command.** It calls `create_app()`, which
requires `SECRET_KEY` from `/etc/dikarya/dikarya.environment.live` — a root-only
file. Use the equivalent Redis check instead; all six must print `0` before you
restart the worker:

```bash
redis-cli LLEN rq:queue:phylo_high   ; redis-cli ZCARD rq:wip:phylo_high
redis-cli LLEN rq:queue:phylo_bulk   ; redis-cli ZCARD rq:wip:phylo_bulk
redis-cli LLEN rq:queue:voucher_sync ; redis-cli ZCARD rq:wip:voucher_sync
```

`rq:queue:<name>` is the pending queue and `rq:wip:<name>` is RQ's
StartedJobRegistry, so a non-zero `wip` means a job is executing *right now* and
restarting will kill it. Re-run the check immediately before the restart, not
once at the start of a long task — a job can arrive in between.

If anything is in flight, wait for it to finish unless the user has accepted
losing that work. The web wrapper needs no such check — restarting Gunicorn only
drops in-progress HTTP requests (and briefly returns 502).

As a backstop, the worker reconciles Postgres against RQ on startup
(`app/services/job_reconcile_service.py`), so a job killed this way is marked
failed on the next boot rather than stranded forever. That limits the damage; it
does not give the user their tree back.

Do not attempt to use sudo for anything else. The tree user is intentionally restricted and should not be able to open a root shell, run arbitrary systemctl commands, edit sudoers, or restart unrelated services.

## What's New / Changelog System

The "What's New" page at `/whats-new` shows changelog entries stored in PostgreSQL, linked in the header nav between "Journal Home" and "Tree Builder".

**When you (an agent) make a major user-visible change, draft a What's New entry but do not add it yet.** Do not add an entry for minor changes. Draft the title, body, and category, then ask the user exactly: **"Add this to What's New?"** Only after explicit approval, add it — see the `whats-new` skill for the exact command, categories, and troubleshooting.

If the user directly asks to "add," "update," "publish," or "announce" something in What's New, that request itself is explicit approval. Do not ask for a second confirmation; choose the appropriate title, body, and category, then publish the entry.

The add and list commands connect to the production PostgreSQL database and require escalated/outside-sandbox permissions on the first attempt — see the `whats-new` skill for the exact invocation and verification steps.

## Claude Review ("Analyze with Claude")

The tree viewer's **Analyze with Claude** button posts to
`/api/job/<id>/analysis/review`, backed by
`app/services/tree_analysis_service.py`. Design details are in
`ARCHITECTURE.md`; the rules that matter when editing it:

- **Never send the alignment itself to the API.** Every statistic is computed in
  `summarize_alignment()` / `summarize_tree()` and only that summary is sent.
  This is what keeps the call fast and the numbers correct — do not "simplify"
  it by pasting FASTA into the prompt.
- **Support classification must stay in step with the viewer.**
  `_classify_support()` mirrors `window.classifySupportType()` in
  `tree_viewer_phylotree_v2.js`. Change one and you must change the other, or
  the review and the on-screen support badge will disagree about the same tree.
  Both are driven by the tree-building method first and by the value shape only
  for an unrecognised method, both take the same `alrt_only` flag (IQ-TREE run
  with `-alrt` and no `-B` writes single SH-aLRT values, not UFBoot ones), and
  both are run over `tests/fixtures/support_classification_cases.json` by
  `tests/test_tree_analysis_metrics.py` — add a case there. The builder itself
  is resolved once, by `resolve_tree_support_context()`, which is what fills
  `window.TREE_METHOD`; do not resolve it separately in the template.
- **Bump `REVIEW_SCHEMA_VERSION`** whenever the prompt or the metric set changes
  in a way that makes an already-stored review misleading. Cached reviews at a
  different version are ignored rather than shown.
- **`scripts/dikarya-claude-review` must never forward arguments to `claude`.**
  It is invoked by a process handling untrusted internet input; `"$@"` there
  means `--tools Bash` and arbitrary code execution as `tree`. Every flag is
  pinned in the wrapper, the prompt comes in on stdin, and the sudoers entry
  ends in `""` so sudo permits no arguments either. If you need a new knob, add
  an environment variable with an allowlist check — do not add a parameter.
- **Sampled column metrics must never be published under an exact-count name.**
  When `column_metrics_are_estimates` is true the bare counts are omitted and
  only `*_estimated` fields are sent. Do not "restore" the plain names for
  convenience — the whole point is that a name without the suffix is always an
  exact tally.
- **Rooting comes from `tree_state.json`, never from topology.** A root of
  degree 3 and a null `outgroup` are both perfectly normal on a midpoint-rooted
  tree, which is the Dikarya default. If the state cannot be read, report the
  rooting as unknown.
- **Re-export the prompt files after editing `SYSTEM_PROMPT` or
  `RESPONSE_SCHEMA`.** The wrapper reads them from `/etc/dikarya-claude-review/`
  (root-owned, so the web process cannot rewrite the reviewer's instructions),
  which means they are a copy that can drift. `scripts/dikarya_export_review_prompt.py
  --check` fails on drift; re-run the two export commands in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- The default backend is `cli` (no API key; needs the root-owned wrapper
  installed). `CLAUDE_REVIEW_BACKEND=api` uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instead —
  put that in `/etc/dikarya/dikarya.environment.live`, **not** in a `.env` at
  the repo root, which crashes Gunicorn.
- The call is synchronous and holds a Gunicorn request slot for ~60–90s, inside
  nginx's `proxy_read_timeout 300`. The timeout chain (wrapper 240s < subprocess
  260s < nginx 300s) and the Redis concurrency ceiling are load-bearing. Do not
  remove them or raise the timeout past nginx.

## Voucher Sync (`/voucher-sync`)

Reads specimen voucher IDs (QR code, OCR fallback) from the last photo of a
user's iNaturalist observations and writes them to an observation field. Ported
from the desktop tool at https://github.com/bthorson1029/inat-voucher-sync.
Rules that matter when editing it:

- **Per-user iNaturalist grants, not the site-wide one.** `/tree/oauth/*` is
  the single admin account that posts tree links. Voucher Sync writes to *each
  user's own* observations, so every user connects their own account
  (`/voucher-sync/oauth/connect`). Grants live in `inat_user_credential`,
  Fernet-encrypted (`INAT_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, else derived from
  `SECRET_KEY`) via `app/services/inat_user_credential_service.py`. Never read
  the `*_enc` columns directly and never put a token in a job argument, RQ
  description, JSON response or log line -- the worker loads it from the DB by
  `run_id`.
- **Runs are `voucher_sync_run` rows, not `Job` rows.** `Job` is the phylo
  pipeline (job_dir, /user/jobs, SSE, reconcile). Live progress streams through
  Redis lists (`voucher_sync:run:<id>:rows|log|cancel`) and the page polls
  `GET /api/voucher-sync/runs/<id>?cursor=N` every 2 s -- deliberately no SSE,
  which holds a Gunicorn slot per stream. Finished rows/summary are persisted
  on the row so Apply re-reads the *server-held* preview; the browser only
  sends observation ids and `confirm_overwrite`.
- **Scans run on the shared RQ worker** (`voucher_sync` queue, listened to
  last). OpenCV/RapidOCR are lazy-imported inside
  `app/services/voucher_sync_service.py`, so the web process never loads them;
  `scripts/dikarya-preflight` checks they import. `rapidocr-onnxruntime`
  requires the *full* `opencv-python`, which needs `libgl1` and `libglib2.0-0`
  on the host.
- **Writes are gated.** Scans are locked to the connected iNat login; one
  active run per user; Apply requires a finished preview, re-fetches any
  overwrite target before the PUT, paces writes at
  `VOUCHER_SYNC_WRITE_PAUSE_SECONDS`, and refuses overwrites unless
  `confirm_overwrite` is set.

## Key Conventions & UI Patterns

- Flask app factory in `app/__init__.py`; extensions initialized in `app/extensions.py`.
- All API responses use JSON; the frontend is a SPA-style UI talking to `/api/` endpoints.
- FASTA sequence headers are sanitized on input and restored on download/display (see `fasta_utils.py`).
- RAxML-NG jobs use named presets (`fast_good`, `standard`, `publication`, `maximum`) defined in `tree_builder_service.py`.
- Job IDs are UUIDs; always validate with regex before using in file paths.
- **Never call `Phylo.write()` for a file under `var/jobs/<id>/tree`.** Use
  `write_tree_file()` from `app/services/tree_io.py` (still re-exported from
  `tree_edit_service.py`). Biopython gets *two* things wrong here:
  - Its default `"%1.5f"` branch-length format rounds anything under 5e-6 to a
    hard zero, and these trees carry nine decimal places with hundreds of
    branches at 6e-9 — a single prune or reroot used to manufacture
    zero-length branches that read as identical sequences everywhere
    downstream.
  - Its **NEXUS writer** emits `TAXLABELS` unquoted and space-separated, so a
    label containing a space, comma, parenthesis or semicolon — i.e. almost
    every fungal label — produced a file no NEXUS reader could parse.
    `tree_io.write_nexus_tree()` replaces it: labels are quoted by
    `quote_tree_label()` and appear only in `TAXLABELS`/`TRANSLATE`, with the
    tree string referring to taxa by integer (what MrBayes and PAUP* do), so a
    parenthesis in a label cannot break the parse.

  `quote_tree_label()` quotes anything not purely alphanumeric. That is
  stricter than Newick alone needs and deliberately so: the same helper backs
  `restore_tree_names()`, which also rewrites NEXUS files, where `-` and `=`
  are punctuation and a bare `_` reads as a space.
- Use existing Tailwind utility style patterns from `templates/sequence_entry.html` and `templates/partials/*.html`.
- Reuse modal structure from `templates/partials/add_sequences_modal.html`.
- Support dark mode (`dark:*` classes) for all new UI.
- Reuse existing color/style tokens (`journal-dark`, `journal-gold`, etc.).
- `showStatus()` is global and provided by `templates/base_modern.html`.

## Change Strategy for AI Agents (Minimal Churn)

- **Do NOT use TDD** — just make the requested changes. The human developer will test the code manually.
- Prefer targeted edits and minimal, production-safe modifications over large refactors.
- Prefer small helper functions over large rewrites when adding features.
- Do NOT split large inline scripts into separate JS files unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Preserve existing DOM IDs and event handler wiring whenever possible.
- Preserve queue behavior strictly:
  - Count badge updates.
  - Empty/non-empty state toggles.
  - Clear/remove actions.
  - Outgroup dropdown refresh (`populateOutgroupDropdown`) after queue changes.
  - Duplicate handling in `addSequences(...)`.

## Reading logs

The `tree` user cannot read the systemd journal (it is in neither `adm` nor
`systemd-journal`, deliberately — that would grant read access to the whole
journal, including sshd auth records). Use these instead, in this order:

| What you want | Where it is | Readable directly? |
|---|---|---|
| **What is actually broken** | `var/logs/errors.log` (WARNING+ only) | yes |
| Daily summary of failures/degradations | `~/.dikarya/log-digests/<date>.txt` | yes |
| Per-job pipeline detail | `var/jobs/<id>/logs/{pipeline,alignment,tree_builder}.log` | yes |
| Gunicorn access/errors | `var/logs/{access,error}.log` | yes |
| Worker app output | `var/logs/worker.log` | yes |
| Unit lifecycle, OOM kills, start failures | journal, via the wrapper below | wrapper only |

**Start with `errors.log`, not `error.log`.** Despite its name, `error.log` is
Gunicorn's combined stream and runs ~98% INFO — real failures are buried in it.
`errors.log` receives WARNING and above only. Nothing is removed from
`error.log`, so the full history is still there when you need context around a
failure.

Every log line emitted inside a request carries its origin:

```
[2026-08-14 08:01:02] [WARNING] [app.api.routes] ... [req=2abb1286 user=someone@example.com job=5db685aa-...]
```

so "who hit this error, on which job?" is a grep rather than a correlation
exercise against `access.log` plus a database query. Lines logged outside a
request (worker startup, CLI) carry no context suffix.

**`DEGRADED` marks work that completed with less than was requested** — a tree
built without its NCBI references, rooting that could not be reapplied, subprocess
limits that could not be applied. These previously looked like success in the
logs. Find them with:

```bash
grep DEGRADED var/logs/errors.log
```

Add new ones with `log_degradation()` from `app/services/log_context.py` rather
than a bare `logger.warning`, so they stay countable.

**The digest replaces ad-hoc `awk`.** It reports non-2xx by endpoint, grouped
exceptions with affected users, degradations, 429s, slow endpoints, and the
heaviest clients:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/dikarya_log_digest.py --hours 24
.venv/bin/python scripts/dikarya_log_digest.py --hours 168
# A job is only listed as having no terminal event once it is older than this
# (default 60 minutes), so a running RAxML job is never called orphaned.
.venv/bin/python scripts/dikarya_log_digest.py --hours 24 --unterminated-grace-minutes 240
```

### Reviewing only logs not reviewed before

Repeated agent log reviews use the durable checkpoint at
`.log-review-checkpoint.json`; conversation history, daily digest timestamps,
file mtimes, and log-rotation boundaries are not review checkpoints.

At the start of a review, run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/dikarya_log_digest.py --since-checkpoint
```

This reads the last successfully reviewed boundary without changing it and
prints an exact half-open UTC window plus a line such as
`checkpoint_candidate=2026-08-22T18:03:00Z`. Investigate and report everything
in that window. Capture the candidate exactly as printed; do not substitute the
time when the investigation finishes, because events arriving during the
review belong to the next review.

Only after the review has completed successfully, advance the checkpoint:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/dikarya_log_digest.py \
  --mark-reviewed 2026-08-22T18:03:00Z
```

Never advance the checkpoint for a failed, interrupted, partial, or merely
started review. The next run will intentionally cover the same records again.
To audit a particular historical interval without touching the checkpoint, use
`--since <ISO-8601 UTC> --until <ISO-8601 UTC>`. To initialize a missing
checkpoint, complete an initial explicit review, then mark its printed
`checkpoint_candidate`.

The window governs which files are opened, not just which records count: only
the live file, rotations that overlap the window, and the one rotation
immediately before it are read, so a 24-hour report does not decompress two
weeks of history. The coverage footer reports `scanned=` (lines read) separately
from `in-window=` (records inside the window), and percentages use the latter.

A cron entry (`ops/cron/dikarya-log-digest`) writes it daily at 07:05 UTC. Output
goes to `~/.dikarya/log-digests/` because `var/logs/` is `dikarya`-owned and the
`tree` user cannot write there.

The access log records **real client IPs** (via `ProxyFix`; it logged `127.0.0.1`
for everything before) and **request duration in microseconds** as the last field
(via `gunicorn.conf.py`, auto-loaded from the working directory).

```bash
# Scoped, read-only journal access. Usage: <unit-keyword> [lines]
sudo /usr/local/sbin/dikarya-journal worker          # defaults to 200 lines
sudo /usr/local/sbin/dikarya-journal web 1000
sudo /usr/local/sbin/dikarya-journal metrics 500 | grep -i error
```

Only `web`, `worker`, and `metrics` are accepted, and the second argument must be
an integer (capped at 5000). The wrapper deliberately forwards **no other
arguments** — `journalctl` ORs its `-u` flags, so passing arbitrary arguments
would let `-u ssh.service` read the entire journal and defeat the scoping. Filter
with your own `grep`/`awk` pipeline instead; that needs no privilege. Source is
`scripts/dikarya-journal`.

**Reach for the journal specifically when a process died rather than logged.**
systemd's own messages (`Main process exited, code=killed, status=9/KILL`, OOM
kills, drop-in start failures) never appear in application stdout, so
`worker.log` will not show them. A clean `Deactivated successfully` in the
journal means a deliberate restart, not a crash.

Note that a web or worker **restart produces a brief 502** while Gunicorn is
down (~3-4 seconds). A 502 that succeeds on retry, with a matching
`Stopping...`/`Started` pair in the journal, is a restart window and not a bug.

**Worker and metrics processes get their stdout/stderr handlers from
`app._install_logging()`, not from `logging.basicConfig()`.** The root logger
carries the WARNING-only `errors.log` mirror, which made RQ's
`_has_effective_handler()` skip installing its own handlers and made
`basicConfig()` a no-op that silently left the root logger at WARNING — killing
every INFO record including `event=job.started`. Non-Gunicorn processes now get
an explicit stdout (INFO+) / stderr (ERROR+) pair; Gunicorn processes
deliberately get none, because Gunicorn already owns those streams. If a new
process type stops logging, look there first.

`var/logs/worker.log` is fed by `StandardOutput=append:` in
`/etc/systemd/system/dikarya-worker.service.d/logging.conf` (source:
`scripts/dikarya-worker-logging.conf`). It only captures output from processes
started *after* that drop-in was loaded — if the file is empty while output is
still appearing in the journal, the running worker predates the config and needs
a restart (check for in-flight jobs first). Rotation is handled by
`ops/logrotate/dikarya`; the file must stay `dikarya`-owned so the in-process
logrotate in `app/services/log_rotation.py` can truncate it.

## Ops / Debugging Notes

- Production runs under systemd (Gunicorn web + worker services).
- If route changes do not appear in production, Gunicorn reload/restart may be required.
- `127.0.0.1` is not reachable for website tests in this environment; use `https://dikarya.us` for local website testing instead.
- Check app logs for 500 errors before changing code (see "Reading logs" above).
- `py-spy` is installed at `/usr/local/bin/py-spy`. Use it before restarting a hung
  web process, because a restart destroys the evidence:

  ```bash
  # What is every thread of a worker doing right now?
  sudo /usr/local/bin/py-spy dump --pid <gunicorn-worker-pid>
  # Live top-style view
  sudo /usr/local/bin/py-spy top --pid <gunicorn-worker-pid>
  ```

  **Agents cannot run this themselves.** Gunicorn workers run as the `dikarya`
  user, py-spy needs ptrace (root), and the `tree` user's passwordless sudo covers
  only the four wrappers listed above and below. Ask the human to run the dump and
  paste the output (in Claude Code they can prefix the command with `! ` to run it
  in session). If this becomes routine, add a root-owned wrapper following the
  same pattern as `dikarya-journal`, e.g. `/usr/local/sbin/dikarya-pyspy <pid>`,
  validating the PID argument rather than forwarding it blindly.

  Gunicorn runs `--workers 4 --threads 2`, so only **8 requests can be in flight at
  once**. A hang where workers are alive but idle (low CPU, few established sockets
  on `:8000`) means those slots are held by handlers that are sleeping rather than
  working — dump the threads to find which handler. Long-lived streaming endpoints
  such as `/api/job/<id>/events` (SSE) are the usual suspects.
- Jobs stuck in a non-terminal state (`queued`/`running`) keep SSE streams alive and
  consume request slots. Reap them with `flask reap-stuck-jobs` (see Commands).

## Documentation Split

- **CLAUDE.md** = implementation guidance, conventions, and safe-edit rules.
- **ARCHITECTURE.md** = deeper system design and reference details.

If making substantial changes, consult `ARCHITECTURE.md` for subsystem context, but keep code changes aligned with the conventions in this file.
