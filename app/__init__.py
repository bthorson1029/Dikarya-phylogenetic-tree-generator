    """Attach request context to log records and split WARNING+ into its own file.

    Alan 8/14/26 - Two findings from reading production logs:

    * error.log was 98.5% INFO (263 of 267 lines), and a single line --
      "Validated Mycomap URL, extracted blast_id" -- was 37% of the whole file.
      Real errors were buried, which is a large part of why the internal-node
      reroot bug went unnoticed across two users and a week. WARNING and above now
      also go to var/logs/errors.log, which is the "what is broken" view. Nothing
      is removed from error.log, so this cannot lose information.
    * Error lines had no job/user/request, making "who hit this?" a multi-step
      correlation. RequestContextFilter fixes that for every handler.

    Alan 8/15/26 - Attaching that mirror to the root logger silently switched off
    worker logging: it left the root logger at its default WARNING (killing every
    app.* INFO record, the per-job pipeline.log capture, and job.started /
    job.completed), and it made RQ's _has_effective_handler() believe RQ logging
    was already configured, so RQ never installed the stdout/stderr handlers that
    fill worker.log. Both are now set explicitly instead of being inherited from
    a logging.basicConfig() call that had become a no-op.
